    A* search: finds the optimal path using a heuristic to guide exploration.
    
    HEURISTIC FUNCTION JUSTIFICATION:
    This implementation uses weighted Hamming distance as the default heuristic.
    The Hamming distance counts the number of differing bits between two states,
    which represents a lower bound on the number of moves needed (since each move
    can change at most one bit).
    
    ADMISSIBILITY: The weighted Hamming heuristic is admissible because:
    1. Each bit that differs must be flipped at least once
    2. Each flip costs at least the weight for that bit position
    3. Therefore, the sum of weights for differing bits never overestimates the
       actual minimum cost
    
    CONSISTENCY: The heuristic is also consistent (monotonic) because:
    - Moving from state s to neighbor s' by flipping bit i:
      - Decreases h by weight[i] if it matches the goal (progress toward goal)
      - Increases h by weight[i] if it differs from goal (moving away)
      - The actual cost is also weight[i], so h(s) â‰¤ cost(s, s') + h(s')
    
    This makes A* optimal: it's guaranteed to find the minimum-cost path when
    the heuristic is admissible and consistent.

    """
    Return a safe path with minimal total cost between two binary states.
    
    ALGORITHM CHOICE JUSTIFICATION:
    This function uses A* search for finding the minimum-cost path because:
    
    1. OPTIMALITY GUARANTEE: A* with an admissible heuristic guarantees finding
       the minimum-cost path. The weighted Hamming distance heuristic is admissible
       (never overestimates the true cost).
    
    2. EFFICIENCY: A* is more efficient than uninformed searches (BFS, DFS, IDDFS)
       when costs vary between moves. The heuristic guides exploration toward the
       goal, reducing the number of states explored compared to BFS.
    
    3. GENERALITY: A* handles both:
       - Uniform costs (when weights is None): equivalent to BFS but with same
         optimality guarantee
       - Non-uniform costs (when weights is provided): finds minimum-cost path
         considering different costs for flipping different bits
    
    4. COMPARISON WITH ALTERNATIVES:
       - BFS: Only optimal for uniform costs; doesn't consider varying weights
       - DFS: Not optimal; may find expensive paths
       - IDDFS: Similar limitations to BFS regarding cost awareness
       - Dijkstra's: A* reduces to Dijkstra's when h=0, but our heuristic makes
         it faster by prioritizing promising paths
    
    COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
    - Time: O(2^n * log(2^n)) where n is the state length, due to priority queue
    - Space: O(2^n) for open and closed sets
    - In practice: Much better than worst-case due to heuristic guidance
