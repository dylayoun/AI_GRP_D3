Hinger Games Overview 

 

Grid made from M rows and N columns top left cell is (0,0) 

Each cell can be either Empty or active where there is a pile of 1 or more counters 

2 cells (a,b) and (x,y) can be described as adjacent if max{(a-x),(b-y)}=1 

Binary state is a board that each cell contains exactly one or zero counters 

An active region R has 3 properties: 

Each cell in R is active 

Any 2 cells in R are connected via a path of adjacent active cells within R 

All active cells adjacent to any cell in R are also included in R  

A move consists of removing one counter from an active pile. The cost of a move is one plus the number of active cells the cell is adjacent to. 

A Hinger is a special active cell whereby it only has one counter and once a move is made on it, 
the cell will become empty and the number of active regions will increase by 1.  

Each player will take turns making moves and the game will end once a move on a hinger is made. If there is no such moves, the game will end in a draw.  

 

A safe path between 2 states S1 and S2, is a sequence of moves which transform S1 into S2 without any intermediate states containing a hinger cell. 
So the whole transition must avoid increasing the number of active regions on the board.
